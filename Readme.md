# AI Mental Health System

This project provides an AI-driven mental health system offering Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Logotherapy. The system allows users to engage in conversations with an AI-powered chatbot, guiding them through emotional well-being exercises. It supports user authentication and administrative control over the platform.

## Features

### 1. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**
   - **Reflective Conversations**: The chatbot engages users in reflective conversations, helping them explore emotions, thought patterns, and behaviors.
   - **Personalized Prompts**: Based on the user's age group (Adolescents, Young Adults, Adults), CBT prompts are tailored to better resonate with their developmental stage.
   - **Cognitive Bias Identification**: The system identifies cognitive biases and helps users gain insight into these patterns.

### 2. **Logotherapy**
   - **Transition from CBT to Logotherapy**: If the system identifies the user has made enough progress in CBT, it transitions them to Logotherapy. This phase helps users explore their purpose, values, and long-term resilience.
   - **Meaning Making Prompts**: The system guides users in finding meaning in life by asking questions related to their values, past experiences, and goals.

### 3. **Admin-Controlled Article Generation**
   - **Article Generation**: Admin users can generate philosophical and psychological articles using custom AI prompts.
   - **AI-Powered**: Articles are dynamically created using the GPT-4o model and can be saved and downloaded in DOCX format.
   - **Article Storage**: Generated articles are stored in a PostgreSQL database, making them easily accessible for future use.

### 4. **User Authentication**
   - **Secure Login**: Users can register and log in using OAuth2 with JWT tokens.
   - **Role-Based Access Control**: Only admin users can generate articles or access administrative features. Other users are limited to CBT and Logotherapy features.
